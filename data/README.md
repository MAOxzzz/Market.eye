# Market Eye AI - Data Directory

This directory contains all data resources for the Market Eye AI project.

## Directory Structure

- **stock_data/** - Stock price datasets

  - `enhanced_dataset.csv` - Enhanced dataset with more historical stock data
  - `expanded_dataset.csv` - (Generated) Dataset with synthetic data points for ML training
  - `uploaded_dataset.csv` - (Generated) User-uploaded dataset through Streamlit interface
  - `current_data.csv` - (Generated) Current working dataset
  - `updated_dataset.csv` - (Generated) Dataset updated with simulated prices

- **docs/** - Documentation resources

  - `price_comparison.png` - Example chart comparing predicted vs actual prices
  - `forecast_plot.png` - Example forecast visualization
  - `Stock_Forecast_Report.pdf` - Example PDF report generated by the system

- **reference/** - Reference implementations

  - `reference_implementation.py` - Original implementation for reference

- **schema.sql** - Database schema for user accounts and activity logs

## Dataset Format

The stock price datasets follow this structure:

- `Date` - Trading date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `Ticker` - Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
- `Open` - Opening price for the day
- `High` - Highest price during the day
- `Low` - Lowest price during the day
- `Close` - Closing price for the day
- `Volume` - Trading volume (number of shares)

## Usage

Different components of the Market Eye AI system will read from and write to these data directories:

1. The LSTM forecasting model uses stock_data/\*.csv files for training
2. The data updater script updates current_data.csv with simulated future prices
3. The Streamlit app can load and display all these datasets
4. When users upload their own datasets, they are saved to uploaded_dataset.csv
